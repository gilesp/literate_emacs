# Semi-Literate Emacs Configuration

My emacs configuration, [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) style.

All the configuration is done in [emacs.org](emacs.org), which gets tangled into `emacs.el` so that the configuration code can be used by emacs.

[init.el](init.el) exists just to trigger the interpreting & loading of emacs.org.
